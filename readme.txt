This is a pair of scripts, in python3 and bash, that implements seeded runs in Luck Be A Landlord, by editing the save. (I hope it works in Windows Subsystem for Linux; somebody, let me know!)

seed.py is a python3 script that takes as input a LBAL.save and a seed string, and outputs a save that's identical except for the current roll (2-3 cards depending whether you have Shattered Mirror). It generates endless sequences of rarities, symbols, and items, and inserts them into the save according to the situation in the save, e.g. taking luck modifiers into account. It keeps track of its place in the sequences by maintaining a file named SEEDSTRING.dat, where SEEDSTRING is the seed string. (So any non-empty string can be a seed as long as it can be used in a filename.)

play.sh is a bash script that takes as input the locations of LBAL's executable and LBAL.save and, optionally, a seed string (otherwise it will use the current time), and alternates endlessly between running LBAL and seed.py. On my computer, the invocation looks like this:

./play.sh ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Luck\ be\ a\ Landlord/Luck\ be\ a\ Landlord.x86_64 ~/.local/share/godot/app_userdata/Luck\ be\ a\ Landlord/LBAL.save SEEDSTRING

i.e.

./play.sh EXECLOCATION SAVELOCATION SEEDSTRING

Make a backup of your LBAL.save in case something goes wrong. Once you've invoked play.sh, you play the game as usual, except every time you get a card choice, you ignore the choices generated by the game, and close the window (Alt+F4 or clicking the X is faster than the in-game menu), which causes the scripts to edit the save then reopen the game, at which point you can Continue with the choices generated by the seed. When you actually want to quit, use Ctrl+C to interrupt the script, which will cause the game to exit.

Share seed strings with your friends and compare how you do! I'm Xom#7240 on Discord if you have any questions or feedback, or want to share seeds!

In LBAL v0.6, there is a save bug which means you should avoid saving during certain situations, so you won't be able to use the seed on every roll. Specifically, you shouldn't save on both the item roll and the symbol roll before it; it's only safe to save once per rent round. I recommend not applying the seed to the symbol roll before the item roll for now. Other than that roll, it is safe to apply the seed to every reroll. Another unsafe time to save is during Lunchbox rolls; I'm not sure about other roll-generating items like Symbol Bombs, but I would avoid those too for now. The bug is believed to be fixed in the upcoming v0.7.

When v0.7 is released, it's likely that the only necessary update to the script will be to the symbol and item IDs in seed.py, which I'll do ASAP, but who knows for sure, we'll see.
