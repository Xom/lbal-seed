This is a pair of scripts, in python3 and bash, that implements seeded runs in Luck Be A Landlord, by editing the save. (I hope it works in Windows Subsystem for Linux; somebody, let me know!)

seed.py is a python3 script that takes as input a LBAL.save and a seed string, and outputs a save that's identical except for the current roll (2-3 cards depending whether you have Shattered Mirror). It generates endless sequences of rarities, symbols, and items, and inserts them into the save according to the situation in the save, e.g. taking luck modifiers into account. It keeps track of its place in the sequences by maintaining a file named SEEDSTRING.dat, where SEEDSTRING is the seed string. (So any non-empty string can be a seed as long as it can be used in a filename. For convenience, auto-generated seeds have zz- as a prefix.)

play.sh is a bash script that takes as input the locations of LBAL's executable and LBAL.save and, optionally, a seed string, and alternates endlessly between running LBAL and seed.py. On my computer, the invocation looks like this:

./play.sh ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Luck\ be\ a\ Landlord/Luck\ be\ a\ Landlord.x86_64 ~/.local/share/godot/app_userdata/Luck\ be\ a\ Landlord/LBAL.save (SEEDSTRING)

i.e.

./play.sh EXECLOCATION SAVELOCATION (SEEDSTRING)

Make a backup of your LBAL.save in case something goes wrong. Once you've invoked play.sh, you play the game as usual, except every time you get a card choice, you ignore the choices generated by the game, and close the window (Alt+F4 or clicking the X is faster than the in-game menu), which causes the scripts to edit the save then reopen the game, at which point you can Continue with the choices generated by the seed. When you actually want to quit, use Ctrl+C to interrupt the script, which will cause the game to exit.

Share seed strings with your friends and compare how you do! I'm Xom#7240 on Discord if you have any questions or feedback, or want to share seeds!

LBAL v0.7 appears to have fixed LBAL v0.6's save bug that had a severe impact on this mod. If you encounter any problems, please let me know.

To elaborate, the bug made it unsafe to save in some situations, which meant you couldn't apply the seed to every roll. Specifically, you couldn't save on both the item roll and the symbol roll before it; it was only safe to save once per rent round. Another unsafe time to save was during Lunchbox rolls.
